A web implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm at NOVA Portugal. It uses Mapbox for the visualization parts, so you'd need to add your token and map project whatnot code in the appropriate spots in index.php. Otherwise, if you were to throw this code onto a php/web server, you could get a visual result with: example.com/index.php?start=A&end=B. Similarly, you could get the length of the path with example.com/stats.php?start=A&end=B. Good times.
